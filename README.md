# Rustfish

Rust port of Stockfish, continuation by SnowballSH.

Rustc version tested: `cargo 1.55.0-nightly (d21c22870 2021-07-26)`

Compile with: cargo build **--release**

This is a continuation of [syzygy1's Rustfish](https://github.com/syzygy1/Rustfish), aiming to update it to Stockfish
14, and maintain it regularly (since syzygy's repo is silent for 3 years).

Currently up-to-date with Stockfish 9 dev.
